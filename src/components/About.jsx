        I’m a Computer Science student with a strong interest in building real-world solutions through full-stack development, automation, and artificial intelligence. I enjoy combining clean, scalable code with creative ideas to develop impactful applications that simplify people’s lives.
        <br /><br />
        I’ve worked across the stack using technologies like React, Node.js, MongoDB, OpenAI, Neo4j, and C++, and I’m always exploring new tools that push my skills forward. Whether it’s building AI-powered resume analyzers, smart home automation, or scalable platforms for underrepresented communities, I bring a hands-on, problem-solving mindset to every project.
        <br /><br />
        I'm actively looking for a Summer 2025 Software Development Internship, where I can collaborate with a fast-paced team, contribute to meaningful work, and grow as a developer. Let's build something awesome together.
